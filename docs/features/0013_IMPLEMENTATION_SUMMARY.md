# Feature 0013: OpenAI API Key Alignment - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented API key resolution across the system to support both system keys (from .env) and user-provided keys (in distributed application). The implementation enables proper key resolution, validation, and service reloading without requiring application restart.

## Implementation Completed

### 1. Backend Changes

#### New File: `backend/core/api_key_resolver.py`
- Created comprehensive API key resolution layer
- Implements fallback chain: user custom key → system .env key → None
- Handles decryption of user-provided keys using APIKeyManager
- Provides singleton resolver instance via `get_api_key_resolver()`
- Includes logging of key sources without exposing actual key values
- Supports OpenAI, Cohere, and Google API keys

Key functions:
- `resolve_openai_key()` - Resolves OpenAI API key
- `resolve_cohere_key()` - Resolves Cohere API key
- `resolve_google_key()` - Resolves Google API key
- `get_key_source()` - Returns 'user' or 'system' for logging

#### Updated: `backend/main.py`
- Modified `lifespan()` function to use API key resolver
- Loads user settings and resolves OpenAI key before RAG initialization
- Logs which key source is being used (system/user)
- Properly handles missing keys with informative warnings

#### Updated: `backend/api/routes/settings.py`
**Enhanced API key validation:**
- Actual OpenAI API validation using embedding test call
- Real Cohere API validation (when SDK available)
- Format validation for Google Cloud keys
- Returns detailed error messages for validation failures

**Enhanced settings application:**
- Added `reload_rag_with_settings()` helper function
- Attempts to reload RAG engine when custom API keys are provided
- Automatically reinitializes services without requiring restart
- Returns `restart_required` flag only if reload fails
- Includes `applied_services` list in response

**New test-mode endpoint:**
- POST `/settings/test-mode` for development testing
- Allows checking active key source
- Only available in non-production environments
- Useful for verifying key resolution behavior

#### Updated: `backend/api/routes/analytics.py`
- Modified `get_analytics_service()` to use key resolution
- Loads user settings and resolves OpenAI key for analytics
- Creates OpenAI client with resolved key
- Logs key source for debugging

#### Updated: `backend/core/config.py`
- Added comprehensive documentation comments
- Documented API key resolution flow
- Clarified that config provides fallback system keys only
- Explained resolution happens in `api_key_resolver.py`

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Updated: `covenantrix-desktop/src/types/global.d.ts`
- Extended `applySettings` response type to include:
  - `restart_required?: boolean`
  - `applied_services?: string[]`
- Extended `validateApiKeys` response type to include:
  - `openai_valid?: boolean | null`
  - `cohere_valid?: boolean | null`
  - `google_valid?: boolean | null`
  - `message?: string`
  - `errors?: Record<string, string>`

#### Updated: `covenantrix-desktop/src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx`
- Enhanced `applySettings()` to handle reload notifications
- Logs service reload status
- Checks for `restart_required` and `rag_engine_reloaded` flags
- Maintains backwards compatibility

#### Updated: `covenantrix-desktop/src/features/settings/ApiKeysTab.tsx`
- Changed from simulated to real API key validation
- Calls backend `/settings/api-keys/validate` endpoint
- Shows actual validation results from API
- Displays specific error messages when validation fails
- Real-time validation on blur for each key field

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Key Resolution Layer
✅ Central resolution logic in `api_key_resolver.py`
✅ Supports custom user keys and system fallback keys
✅ Handles encryption/decryption transparently
✅ Proper error handling and logging
✅ No exposure of sensitive key values in logs

### 2. RAG Engine Initialization
✅ Uses resolved keys at startup
✅ Loads user settings before initialization
✅ Logs key source for debugging
✅ Handles missing keys gracefully

### 3. Settings Apply Enhancement
✅ Attempts to reload services with new keys
✅ No restart required when reload succeeds
✅ Helper function for RAG reinitialization
✅ Detailed response with applied services list

### 4. API Key Validation
✅ Real OpenAI API validation with embedding call
✅ Real Cohere API validation (when SDK available)
✅ Format validation for Google Cloud
✅ Detailed error messages for failures
✅ Frontend integration with actual validation

### 5. Analytics Service Update
✅ Uses key resolution for service creation
✅ Loads user settings before initializing
✅ Logs key source for analytics operations
✅ Proper error handling

### 6. Frontend Integration
✅ Updated TypeScript types for new response fields
✅ Real API validation in settings UI
✅ Reload notification handling
✅ Error display for validation failures

### 7. Testing Support
✅ Test-mode endpoint for development
✅ Query active key source
✅ Verify resolution behavior
✅ Disabled in production

## Key Resolution Flow

### Startup (main.py)
```
Load .env → Load user_settings.json → Resolve keys → Initialize RAG
```

### Runtime (settings endpoint)
```
User updates keys → Validate keys → Save to user_settings.json → 
Apply settings → Reload RAG → Return success
```

### Resolution Priority
```
1. User custom mode + key exists → Use user key (decrypted)
2. Otherwise → Use system .env key
3. Otherwise → None (service disabled)
```

## Security Considerations

✅ User custom keys encrypted using `APIKeyManager` before storage
✅ Keys decrypted only when needed for API calls
✅ Never log actual key values, only sources (system/user)
✅ Validation endpoint doesn't store keys, only tests them
✅ Test-mode endpoint disabled in production environment
✅ Proper error handling prevents key exposure in error messages

## Logging Implementation

Structured logging at key points:
- "Resolving {type} key: mode={mode}, source={source}"
- "RAG engine initialized with key from: {source}"
- "API key validation: type={type}, result={valid/invalid}"
- "Services reloaded with new key configuration"
- "Key resolution fallback: user key not available, using system key"

## Error Handling

1. Invalid user key → Fall back to system key with warning
2. Both keys unavailable → Disable AI features with clear message
3. RAG reload fails during apply → Return error but keep old instance running
4. Validation failures → Provide specific error messages

## Testing Strategy

### Development Testing
1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file
2. Start application - verify system key usage
3. Switch to custom mode via settings UI
4. Enter different key and apply
5. Verify logs show "Using OpenAI key from: user"
6. Switch back to default mode
7. Verify logs show "Using OpenAI key from: system"

### Distribution Testing
1. No `.env` file present
2. Launch application - should show onboarding
3. User enters their OpenAI key
4. Services initialize with user key
5. Verify all AI features work

### Test-Mode Testing (Development Only)
1. Use `/settings/test-mode` endpoint to check active key source
2. Verify resolution behavior in both modes
3. Confirm services work with both key sources
