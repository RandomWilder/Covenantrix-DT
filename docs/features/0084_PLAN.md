# Paid Tier Activation UX Enhancement

## Feature Description

When a user activates a valid PAID tier license (not trial, free, or paid_limited), implement two UX enhancements:

1. **Confetti Effect**: A celebratory visual animation to mark the successful upgrade
2. **Upgrade Notification**: A system notification informing the user of their new paid status and available benefits

This enhancement only triggers for successful PAID tier activations, not for any other tier transitions.

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify

**Frontend Components:**
- `covenantrix-desktop/src/features/subscription/SubscriptionTab.tsx` - Add confetti trigger on successful PAID activation
- `covenantrix-desktop/src/contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx` - Add confetti state management
- `covenantrix-desktop/src/components/ui/ConfettiEffect.tsx` - New component for confetti animation

**Backend Services:**
- `backend/domain/subscription/service.py` - Add notification creation for PAID tier activation
- `backend/domain/notifications/service.py` - Create upgrade notification

**Styling:**
- `covenantrix-desktop/src/styles/globals.css` - Add confetti animation keyframes

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Confetti Effect Component
1. Create `ConfettiEffect.tsx` component with CSS-based animation
2. Add confetti trigger state to `SubscriptionContext`
3. Integrate confetti trigger in `SubscriptionTab.tsx` success handler
4. Style with Tailwind classes for colors and positioning

#### Phase 2: Backend Notification
1. Modify `SubscriptionService.activate_license()` to detect PAID tier activation
2. Create upgrade notification via existing `NotificationService`
3. Use `subscription` source type for proper categorization

### Key Implementation Details

**Confetti Trigger Logic:**
- Only trigger when `new_tier === 'paid'` in license activation response
- Use existing success state in `SubscriptionTab.tsx` (line 58)
- Auto-cleanup after animation completes (3-4 seconds)

**Notification Content:**
- Title: "Welcome to Paid Tier!"
- Content: List of newly available benefits (unlimited docs, queries, etc.)
- Source: `subscription` type for proper categorization
- Auto-dismiss after user interaction

**Animation Specifications:**
- Pure CSS keyframes animation (no external dependencies)
- Multiple colored particles falling from top
- 3-4 second duration with fade-out
- Triggered only on successful PAID tier activation
- Non-intrusive, celebratory tone

### Architecture Considerations

- Maintains existing separation of concerns
- Uses established notification infrastructure
- Follows current component patterns
- Zero new dependencies required
- Non-breaking changes to existing functionality

### Validation Requirements

- Confetti only triggers for `tier === 'paid'` activations
- Notification only created for successful PAID tier transitions
- No effects for trial, free, or paid_limited tier changes
- Proper cleanup of animation elements
- Integration with existing notification system
