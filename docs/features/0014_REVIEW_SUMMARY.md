## Issues Found & Resolved

### ✅ Fixed During Review
**Duplicate Helper Functions**

### 🟡 Minor Observations (Non-blocking)
1. **Per-key validation display** - May need verification for individual key status in UI
2. **SettingsModal size** - 398 lines, consider splitting if grows beyond 500
3. **E2E tests needed** - Should add tests for all 7 scenarios

   - No fallback between custom/default modes
   - Clear logging for debugging
   - Proper error handling

2. **User Experience** 👍
   - Clear feature guard banners
   - Actionable error messages
   - Graceful degradation

3. **Type Safety** 🔒
   - Complete TypeScript interfaces
