## Known Limitations

1. **Upgrade Flow Not Implemented**: The "Upgrade Now" and "Resolve Payment" buttons currently just log to console. Actual payment/upgrade flow needs to be implemented.

2. **i18n Strings**: Translation keys are defined but actual translations may need to be added to translation files.

3. **Usage Stats Widget**: Created but not yet integrated into sidebar or other locations (optional component).

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test all Phase 3 functionality
2. **i18n**: Add actual translations for all subscription-related strings
3. **Payment Integration**: Implement the actual upgrade/payment flow
4. **Usage Stats Widget**: Decide on placement (sidebar, header, etc.)
5. **Documentation**: Update user documentation with subscription tier information

## Status

**Phase 3: COMPLETE ✅**

All components, contexts, feature gates, and UI elements have been implemented and integrated. The system is ready for testing.

**Next**: Begin comprehensive testing of all Phase 3 functionality.
